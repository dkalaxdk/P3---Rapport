\chapter{Application Domain Analysis} \label{ch:applicationdomain}
In this chapter, the application domain has been analysed. This analysis involves the different actors, whom the system will be designed to interact with, and the different use cases these actors will go through as they use the system. The use cases have been constructed based on the requirements and the system definition, and make up a basis for the design of the interface and functionality of the system. Based on these, a functions list has been constructed.
