\chapter{Application Domain Analysis} \label{ch:applicationdomain}
In this chapter, the application domain has been analyzed. The analysis involves the different actors, whom the system will be design to interact with, and the different use cases these actors will go through, as they use the system. The use cases have been built on the requirements-list and system definition, and make a basis for the further interface design and functionality of the system. Based on these, a function list has been constructed and elaborated upon.
