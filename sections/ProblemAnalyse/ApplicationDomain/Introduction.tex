\chapter{Application Domain Analysis} \label{ch:applicationdomain}
In this chapter, the application domain has been analyzed. This analysis involves the different actors, whom the system will be designed to interact with, and the different use cases these actors will go through, as they use the system. The use cases have been constructed based on the requirements and the system definition, and make up a basis for the design of the interface and functionality of the system. Based on these, a function list has been constructed and elaborated upon.

To elaborately describe the needed functionality of the system, the usage of the system has been analysed. This description will be used to facilitate the design of the system and to ensure that it accommodates the way the actors will interact with it.
