\chapter{Application Domain Analysis} \label{ch:applicationdomain}
In this chapter, the application domain has been analyzed. This analysis involves the different actors, whom the system will be designed to interact with, and the different use cases these actors will go through, as they use the system. The use cases have been built based on the requirements and the system definition, and make up a basis for the design of the interface and functionality of the system. Based on these, a function list has been constructed and elaborated upon.

First the usage of the system has been analysed in order to facilitate the design of the system so it accommodates the way the users are going to work with it.
