\begin{itemize}
    \item Morten (IT)
    \item Kasper (IT)
    \item Employees at the zoo
\end{itemize}

\par
No physiological, physiological or social differences to speak of. Morten and Kasper are both IT people, which means they are used to working with computers. However, they have requested the interface to be minimalistic and easy to use, which means most people should be able to use it.
The other employees at the zoo have experience with other computer-based systems through their work.

\textbf{Activities}: \\
%(Purpose of activities to be supported by the system, Temporal aspects, Collaboration, Complexity, Safety criticality, Nature of system content) \\
The system will support registration of assets, and helping users keep track of them. The IT-department adds, edits, updates and removes assets from the system and exports list of assets. They also log changes to the assets and keep track of the assets. On occasion they want a specific asset, which should be easily available to them.
The rest of the employees only use the system to see assets and their current state.
\par

\textbf{Context}: \\
%(Physical, Social, Organizational) \\
The system will be used at Aalborg Zoo, primarily on a desktop or laptop located in the office of the IT department. The laptops might be moved around the premise of the zoo. The software does not contain any elements geared towards any social aspects.
