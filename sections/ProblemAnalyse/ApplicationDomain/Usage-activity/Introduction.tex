\section{Usage}\label{sc:usage}
Within this section, the usage of the system, which include a list of actors and relevant use cases, has been analysed. This part of the application domain is important to understand, in order to create a  satisfactory user experience and offer all the relevant functionality in the finished system. Firstly, the actors and use cases have been identified and connected in an actor table.
\par
The actors in the application domain only include the employees and admins. The differentiation of the two is made, because the admin has access to specific functionality and pages within the system, which are not available to the employee. The admin class is a specialization of the employee class, which means it has the same abilities as the employee, but is granted access to further interactions with the system.
