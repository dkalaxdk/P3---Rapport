\section{Actor Table}\label{sc:actortable}

The actors are involved with different use cases, as described in table \ref{tab:actortable}

\end{table}

As seen in the actor table (table \ref{tab:actortable}) the \textit{admin} is involved in all the use cases, while the \textit{viewer} is only involved in two. This reflects the fact that the program is primarily intended for the \textit{admin}, as they are the ones managing their asserts, while the \textit{viewer} is only given access to view and comment on the assets in the system.
