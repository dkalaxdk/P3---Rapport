\section{Function activity}\label{sc:function}
Based on the use cases, it is possible to determine the functions necessary for the system to adequately fulfill the requirements. These functions have been classified by their type and complexity in the function list (see \autoref{tab:functions}). The complex functions have then been further split into smaller functions to explain their processes. This is done based on the functions analysis and the complexity definitions from \cite[chap 7]{OOAD}. The complexity definitions are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Simple:} Sets or reads the value of an attribute in an existing object.
    \item \textbf{Medium:} Creates a new object and connects it by object structure(s) to other objects.
    \item \textbf{Complex:} Reads from or creates several objects (from different classes).
\end{itemize}

\newpage

With these definitions, the following function table has been constructed:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Function} & \textbf{Complexity} & \textbf{Type} \\
        \hline
        \hline
        Add asset & Complex & Update\\
        \hline
        Remove asset & Simple & Update\\
        \hline
        Update asset information & Complex & Update\\
        \hline
        Comment asset & Medium & Update\\
        \hline
        Search for asset & Medium & Compute/Read\\
        \hline
        View asset & Simple & Read\\
        \hline
        Add department & Simple & Update\\
        \hline
        Remove department & Simple & Update\\
        \hline
        Authenticate user & Simple & Read\\
        \hline
        Check access level & Simple & Read\\
        \hline
        Export list of assets & Complex & Compute/Read\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\caption{Function table showing all the different top-level functions as well as their complexity and type.}\label{tab:functions}
\end{table}

As mentioned earlier, the complex functions have been further split into smaller functions to better understand the operations.

\begin{center}
    \textbf{Add asset}    
\end{center}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Function} & \textbf{Complexity} & \textbf{Type}\\
            \hline
            \hline
            Add relevant information about the asset & Simple & Update \\
            \hline
            Save Asset to model & Medium & Update \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \caption{The table shows the different functions involved in adding an asset as well as their complexity.}
    \label{function:add_asset}
\end{table}


The \textit{Add asset} function consists of three smaller functions, as seen in \autoref{function:add_asset}. When adding an asset, first the admin enters the relevant information, which is then saved with the asset to the model.

\begin{center}
    \textbf{Update asset information}
\end{center}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Function} & \textbf{Complexity} & \textbf{Type}\\
            \hline
            \hline
            Load asset from model & Simple & Read \\
            \hline
            Update relevant information about the asset & Simple & Update \\
            \hline
            Save asset to model & Medium & Update \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \caption{The table shows the different functions involved in updating an assets information.}
    \label{function:update_asset_information}
\end{table}

The \textit{Update asset information} function is made up of the smaller functions, as shown in \autoref{function:update_asset_information}. First, the asset is loaded from the model and formatted as an asset in the system. Then the changes to the information is applied to the asset. The asset is then saved to the model with the changes.

\begin{center}
    \textbf{Export list of assets}
\end{center}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
            \hline
            \textbf{Function} & \textbf{Complexity} & \textbf{Type}\\
            \hline
            \hline
            Load assets to be included & Simple & Read \\
            \hline
            Build list & Simple & Compute \\
            \hline
            Export to CSV-format & Medium & Compute \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \caption{The table shows the different functions involved in exporting a report.}
    \label{function:export_list_of_assets}
\end{table}

The \textit{export list of assets} function involves the three smaller functions listed in \autoref{function:export_list_of_assets}. The first step is that the selected assets are parsed to the function. Then report entries are created based on the assets, which are then added to the report. Finally the report is exported to the admin's computer formatted as a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file.

This concludes the analysis of functions. The understanding of the users and functions has been used in the following section as a basis for the interface.
