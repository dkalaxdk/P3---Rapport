\section{Summary} \label{ssc:ad_summary}
In this chapter, the application domain has been analysed. The different actors that will interact with the system have been identified, and a number of use cases have been described in order to better understand the purpose of the system. Based on this, essential system functions have been described, which were used to examine the requirements for the user interface of the system.

The analysis has been used in designing the system architecture and interface in the following chapter.
