\section{Scope of the Application}\label{sc:scope}
The main purpose of the system is to assist in the management of assets at Aalborg Zoo, specifically their IT department. As such the application should be able to help keep track of the different assets and their information, so the admins know where their assets are and what state they are in. 
\par
The admin will be able to add, edit and remove assets, using tags to provide flexible information about the asset. They will also be able search through existing assets using tags and print out a log of assets, with all their information. This will allow them too keep an overview of their assets. 
\par
Any other users of the system (viewers) are able to search through the assets and comment on assets if they have relevant information to share. The admin and other viewers can then view these comments. 
\par
This results in a flexible system where the admin has control while the viewer can still look through assets they may need to borrow and give feedback on things they have previously borrowed.
