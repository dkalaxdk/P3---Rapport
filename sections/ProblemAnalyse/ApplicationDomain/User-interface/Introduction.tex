The user interface is following the KISS-principle (Keep It Simple Stupid) and therefore only contains the utmost required interface-elements. As mentioned in \autoref{ch:introduction} and \autoref{ch:problemdefinition} our client needs an easier process of maintaining assets compared to existing solutions on the market. Existing solutions often present the user with a number of fields depending on the category an asset belongs to. This often result in empty and unnecessary fields that are never used. Our approach is based on fields dynamically appearing based on tags added to an asset.
