\section{Interface}\label{sc:interface}
The system will not offer an interface for other systems and therefore will only contain a user interface. The requirements imposed on the system in order to accommodate the users have been analyzed through a PACT analysis. Initial considerations and reflections about the design of the user interface (see \autoref{ssc:UIAnalysis}) have also been discussed based on this analysis.
