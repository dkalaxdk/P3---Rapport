\chapter{Problem Domain Analysis}\label{ch:problemdomain}
To ensure that the system is deployable in the context of the problem domain, and solves the problems in it, the domain has been analysed and described in an object-oriented manner. This has eased the transition from understanding the users problems and their context in the problem domain, to the development of a system, which accommodates this understanding and offers the interactions and functionalities needed to solve the problems.
