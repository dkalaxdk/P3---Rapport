\section{Class Activity} \label{sc:class_activity}
To better understand the objects within the problem domain and their connections, the problem domain has been analysed. As a part of this analysis, a number of classes have been defined based on these objects and the events connecting them have been described.
% and the classes present have been defined. This has been done to determine the classes and their relations, as well as defining the events connected to the individual classes.
\par

The analysis of the problem domain has resulted in a class-diagram. The diagram contains the classes present in the problem domain and the relations connecting them.
\par

%As described in \cite{OOAD}, classes are understood as:

%\begin{quote}
%    \textit{A description of a collection of objects sharing structure, behavioral pattern, and attributes.}
%\end{quote}

In this section of the report, the classes should not be confused with system specific classes, which will be described in \autoref{ch:architectural_design}.
