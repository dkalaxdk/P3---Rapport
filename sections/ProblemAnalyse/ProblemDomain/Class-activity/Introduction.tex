\section{Class Activity} \label{sc:classes}
To better understand the objects and their connections, within the problem domain, the problem domain has been analysed and the classes present have been defined. This has been done to determine the classes and their relations, as well as defining the events connected to the individual classes.
\par
The analysis of the problem domain has resulted in a class-diagram. This diagram contains the classes present in the problem domain and the relations connecting them.
