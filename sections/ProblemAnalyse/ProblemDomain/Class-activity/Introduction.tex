\section{Class Activity} \label{sc:class_activity}
As part of the problem domain analysis, a number of classes have been defined based on the objects described in the system definition (see \autoref{sc:SystemDefinition}). The events describing the connections between the classes have then been defined as well.
\par
The analysis of the class activity has resulted in an event table.
