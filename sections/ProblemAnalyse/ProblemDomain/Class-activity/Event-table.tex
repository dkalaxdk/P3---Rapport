\subsection{Event table}\label{ssc:eventtable}
% Vis relationen mellem klasser og events med et event table
To give a visual overview of the events, classes and their relations, an event table has been constructed (\autoref{tab:events}).
%To create a better overview of the events and the connections between these and the classes, an event table (\autoref{tab:events}) has been constructed.
Based on the event table a new class has been added to the system, the \textit{Loan} class. The reason for adding the \textit{Loan} class is explained beneath the event table.
% \par
% As the admin is involved in nearly every change or addition within the system, and these actions need to be saved, these relations have been excluded from the rest of the analysis. This is done to simplify the illustrations and remove cluttering.

\end{table}

Now that the events and there participating classes have been illustrated in the event table, one change has been made.
\par
\textbf{Loan}\\
The \textit{Loan} has not been mentioned prior to the event table, but has been added, because the \textit{Asset loaned out} and \textit{Asset returned}, both have three participating classes. The events can both happen multiple times for all three classes, which is not ideal. To avoid this, another class has been added to the system, the \textit{Loan} class. The \textit{Loan} class connects assets and employees, and stores the id of both. The \textit{Loan} is also an easier way for the \textit{Admin} to administrate the loans.
