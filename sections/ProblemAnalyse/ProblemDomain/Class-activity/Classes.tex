% Asset, Admin, Employee, Department, Location

The problem domain of the project contains three different relevant classes. These classes will be introduced in this section and elaborated upon in the following sections. 
\par

\textbf{Asset}\\
The \textit{Asset} class represents physical assets throughout the zoo. The \textit{Asset} contains attributes storing information related to the asset, such as its location, the current borrower of it, and its specifications.
%information regarding its location in the zoo, as well as information on the current borrower of the \textit{Asset}. An \textit{Asset} can also be configured to have a date of expiration, thereby giving a notification when the asset needs to be replaced.
\par

\textbf{Employee}\\
The \textit{Employee} class represents an employee at the zoo. The \textit{Employee} contains attributes storing the name and department of the given employee. Assets can be loaned out to an \textit{Employee} by an \textit{Admin}.
\par

\textbf{Admin}\\
The \textit{Admin} class represents an administrator. The \textit{Admin} contains the same attributes as the \textit{Employee}. The \textit{Admin} manages the assets, as well as which \textit{Employees} have loaned which assets.
\par
These three classes interact with each other through events, which will be addressed in the following section.
\newline

Two more classes could be said to exist in the problem domain. These are: 
\par
\textbf{Department}\\
The \textit{Department} class reflects a department within the zoo. These \textit{Departments} work as a way of grouping assets within the zoo.
\par

\textbf{Location}\\
The \textit{Location} class represents a physical location in the zoo, in which assets can be stored. 
\par

The \textit{Department} class was not included, as there is only one department in the problem domain (The IT department). Had there been more, this class would have been included. 
\par
The \textit{Location} class was not included because it would mean that the user is restricted to only a specific set of locations, and wouldn't be as flexible.
