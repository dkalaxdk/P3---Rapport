% Opsummer problemdom√¶neanalysen
This chapter has discussed and analysed the different classes and events within the problem domain, as well as the structure and behavior of these.  This has given a understanding of the ways in which the objects in the problem domain acts and interacts. As a result of this analysis it has given an overview of what classes and events to implement into the system. \\
The diagrams and figures from this chapter,will be the foundation on which the Application Domain Analysis will be build, as well as create a foundation for the development of the system.
