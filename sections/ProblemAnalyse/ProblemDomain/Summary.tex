% Opsummer problemdom√¶neanalysen
This chapter has discussed and analysed the different classes and events within the problem domain, as well as the structure and behavior of these. This has given an understanding of the actions and interactions of the objects and an overview of the involved classes and events. This overview has been used as a foundation for the system implementation.\\
The diagrams and figures from this chapter have been used as a basis for the Application Domain Analysis, which has been carried out in the following chapter.
