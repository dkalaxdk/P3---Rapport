\section{Summary} \label{ssc:pd_summary}
This chapter has discussed and analysed the different classes and events within the problem domain, as well as the structure and behavior of these. This has given an understanding of the interactions of the objects and an overview of the involved classes and events. The \textit{Tag} class has been added to the problem domain based on dialog with Aalborg Zoo, and the class has handled the loan of an asset to an employee, as well as improving the organizing of assets. The class diagram (see \autoref{fig:FirstPDClassDiagram}) depicts the classes that will form the core of the system and the connections between these. The event table (see \autoref{tab:events}) has listed all the initial events needed in the system to ensure the wanted functionality. Lastly the state charts of the classes (see \autoref{sc:behavoir}) have given an understanding of how the different classes behave and how they participate in different events.

The overview, derived from these elements, has been used as a foundation for the system design and a better understanding of the application domain, which will be analysed in the following chapter..\\
