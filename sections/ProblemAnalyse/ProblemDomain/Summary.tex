\section{Summary} \label{ssc:pd_summary}
This chapter has discussed and analysed the different classes and events within the problem domain, as well as the structure and behavior of these. This has given an understanding of the interactions between the objects and an overview of the involved classes and events. 
\par 
The \textit{Loan} class has been added to the problem domain based on the event table, and the class handles the loan of an asset to an employee. 
\par
The class diagram (see \autoref{fig:FirstPDClassDiagram}) depicts the classes that will form the foundation of the system and the connections between these classes based on the event table (see \autoref{tab:events}).  
\par
Lastly the state charts for the classes (see \autoref{sc:behavoir}) have given an understanding of how the different classes behave and how they participate in different events.
\par
The overview derived from these analyses has been used as a foundation for the system design and a better understanding of the application domain.
