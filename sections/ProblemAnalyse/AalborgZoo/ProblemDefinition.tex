\section{Problem Definition}

Based on the interviews with Aalborg Zoo, the following problem definition has been formulated:

\begin{quote}
\textit{The IT department at Aalborg Zoo has many assets and no sufficient system to manage the assets.}
\end{quote}

They have not been able to find a viable solution among existing products. It is the goal of this project to develop such a solution. 
\par
To ensure that the representatives of Aalborg Zoo and the project group all agree on the extend of the project, a system definition has been developed based on the interviews from which a list of requirements have been made.
