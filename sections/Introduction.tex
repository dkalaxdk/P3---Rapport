\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
As companies expand and acquire a growing number of assets, the desire to keep track of these assets and their condition grows equally. Creating an overview of the assets, and keeping this overview up to date, is a major task and one that companies sometimes do not address until after the number of assets in their possession has become overwhelming. Therefore a system managing these assets and their current state, would help keep an overview of the assets. The system could also include the ability to see where a specific asset is located, who currently has responsibility for it, and what department the asset belongs to.

The concept of a system like this is not a new idea, as the problem has existed for years, but companies are very different and a "one-size-fits-all" solution is not suitable for all. A way of making such a solution more suitable for a wider range of companies, could be to make it more dynamic. This gives the companies the opportunity to decide for themselves, what information is needed for each asset. With this approach, the individual company will not be overwhelmed with unneeded features, which are only relevant for a few specific companies.

This project will be based on the needs of the IT department of Aalborg Zoo, and will focus on accommodating dynamicity and customizability.
