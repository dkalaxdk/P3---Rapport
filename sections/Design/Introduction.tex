\chapter{Design} \label{ch:architectural_design}
Based on the analysis of the problem and application domains (see \autoref{ch:problemdomain} and \autoref{ch:applicationdomain}) and the system definition (see \autoref{sc:SystemDefinition}), this chapter will define the components and subsystems comprising the final system structure, as well as construct a detailed class diagram.
