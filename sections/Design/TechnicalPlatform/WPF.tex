\subsection{Windows Presentation Foundation} \label{ssc:tech_wpf}
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is used for all interactions with the user. Other frameworks were considered, such as Winforms, which was excluded because WPF has a greater range of functionality. UMP was also considered, but as it requires Windows 10 or newer to run and it is likely that Aalborg Zoo uses an older version of Windows on their computers, this was not a viable option.

As a part of working with WPF the Model-View-ViewModel pattern (MVVM) was used to structure the code. This pattern is designed to make it easier to swap out the UI while keeping the code behind constant. The pattern is also designed to take advantage of the binding functionality of WPF.
