\subsection{Windows Presentation Foundation} \label{ssc:tech_wpf}
The user interface framework used for the system is Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Other frameworks were considered, such as Winforms, which was excluded because WPF has a greater range of functionality. Universal Windows Platform (UWP) was also considered, but as it only runs on Windows 10 or newer, which Aalborg Zoo might not run on all their systems, this was not a viable option.

As a part of working with WPF, the Model-View-ViewModel pattern (MVVM) has been strived towards with the structure of the code. This pattern is designed to make it easier to swap out the UI while keeping the code behind constant. The pattern is also designed to take advantage of the binding functionality of WPF.
