\subsection{.NET Core} \label{ssc:tech_core}
The system will be written in .NET Core 3.1. This has been chosen over .NET Framework, because this framework is being phased out in the future, in order to keep the system up to date. %Furthermore .NET Core allows development of the system for other platforms than Windows. For the current project the system will be run on a Windows machine, but the option to move it to another operating system, should not be ignored.
