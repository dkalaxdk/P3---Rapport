\subsection{.NET Core 3} \label{ssc:tech_core}
The system has been written in .NET Core 3. This has been chosen over .NET Framework, because Framework will be phased out in the future, which makes .NET Core 3 more future proof. .NET Core 3 has been developed to replace .NET Framework and with the ambition to make development across different operating systems easier.
