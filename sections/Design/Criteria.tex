\textbf{Usable:} One of the primary reasons for Aalborg Zoo to get a system developed from scratch, is to get a system that is easy to navigate. Therefore, this is a very important element of the system and the final product. The system is primarily built with usability in focus.

\textbf{Secure:} As the product does not contain any confidential information, security in the system is considered less important. However there is still a minor focus on security, as access to the functions within the program is limited to users with the required permissions.

\textbf{Efficient:} The client has expressed that the efficiency of the system is of little concern, so this criteria is considered less relevant. However, it should still be able to complete the tasks within a reasonable amount of time.

\textbf{Correct:} Aalborg Zoo has given weighted requirements for the system, as seen in \autoref{sc:requirements}. It is very important that the requirements are met upon delivering the finished product. 

\textbf{Reliable:} As part of the heavy focus on the user experience, it is important that the system behaves in a predictable manner, and does this reliably.

\textbf{Maintainable:}
The client has expressed a desire for the program to be maintainable, because they want to maintain the system by themselves. Because they aren't experts in programming, the system should be as easily maintainable as possible, and build on industry standards.

\textbf{Testable:}
As with all other systems, this system should be developed in such a way, that it is testable. This criteria is marked as less important, because it is not the main focus of the project, but it is still regarded as valuable.

\textbf{Flexible:}
The client wants to be able to further develop the system after the product is delivered. Therefore it is very important that it is flexible and without too many dependencies.

\textbf{Comprehensible:}
The system should be comprehensible, as it allows the client to easily add the functionality they need later on. For this reason, this criterion is important.

\textbf{Reusable:}
No part of the system will be used in other systems and therefore, this criterion is irrelevant.

\textbf{Portable:}
The system will only be built for a Windows PC, and for this reason, there is no need for the system to be portable. 

\textbf{Interoperable:}
The system will not communicate with other systems, beside the database component, which means this criterion is less important.
