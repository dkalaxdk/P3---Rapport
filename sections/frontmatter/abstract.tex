Aalborg Zoo has problems managing their assets in an efficient way. Existing asset management systems do not live up to their needs. In this project an alternative has been developed with focus on an adaptable design. 
\\
Their needs were uncovered through semi structured interviews, with representatives from the IT department at the zoo. This has resulted in a list of requirements and a system definition. Based on these a solution has been designed and implemented.
\\
A core part of the developed system is the tagging functionality. With this it is possible to customize the organization of assets, making the system highly adaptable.
\\
The system has been tested using unit tests and usability tests, to make sure it lives up to the requirements.
\\
The final product has been deemed an adequate and satisfactory solution to Aalborg Zoo's problem.
