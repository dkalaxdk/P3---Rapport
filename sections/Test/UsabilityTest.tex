\section{Usability Testing}\label{sc:UsabilityTesting}
Usability tests were used to ensure an intuitive and simple user interface for the system. In these tests a test participant would solve a number of tasks designed to illuminate any problem areas in the UI design.

During the participants' interactions with the system, they were told to talk through their thought process, which gave a better understanding of their expectations and reactions to the design as a whole, as well as each specific element of the design. The participants' experience of using the system, was then discussed with the participants after the usability test.

Through this evaluation, a better understanding of the problems, frustrations, and needs of the participants was achieved.
