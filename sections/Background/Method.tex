% Processor!
The project has been produced as a group project with a group of seven members. Throughout the project period, multiple courses has been attended by the members on a weekly basis, and these courses has been an academic basis for the entire project. The courses have taken time from the project work, but has contributed irreplaceable knowledge to its group members. The time not spent on courses has been used to develop this report and the product system.

To ensure the quality of the end product, the development has been done using an iterative process, where the project as a whole has been entirely or partly redesigned through multiple iterations. The first iteration has consisted of disconnected parts, which were tested and evaluated. The later iterations have then been based on the tests and evaluations from the previous steps, and has conferred with additional ones. Through this process, essential elements have been implemented early in the process for further testing opportunities and evaluation. This has also meant that the features less crucial to the system have been implemented later and as extra features contrary to being core functionalities.
\par
Though some features have been added at a later stage in the development cycle, all features and core functionalities have been thoroughly tested and have succeeded these test. If a feature or functionality has failed the tests made for it, it has been removed from the final project and added to the list of additional features for the next version.
