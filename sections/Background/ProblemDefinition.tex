\section{Problem Definition}
Based on the interviews with Aalborg Zoo, the following problem definition has been formulated:

\begin{quote}
    \textit{The IT department at Aalborg Zoo has many assets and no sufficient system to manage the assets.}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
    \textit{How can a system help Aalborg Zoo manage their assets better than existing tools can?}
    
    How can a system be created to help the IT department at Aalborg Zoo manage their assets?
    
    How to develop a software system to help the IT department at Aalborg Zoo to manage their systems?
    
    How can a system, that helps Aalborg Zoo manage their assets, be designed and implemented?
    
    How can a software solution help manage Aalborg Zoo's assets?
\end{quote}

They have not been able to find a viable solution among existing products. It is the goal of this project to develop such a solution.

To ensure that the representatives of Aalborg Zoo and the project group all agree on the extent of the project, a system definition has been developed based on the interviews from which a list of requirements have been made.
