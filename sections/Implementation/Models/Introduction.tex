\section{Models}
The model classes in the system define the data structures of the different model components (see \autoref{sc:model_component}). These all inherits from a general \textit{Model} class which contains information that all data models in the system share, such as ID in the database, Created\_At and Updated\_At. 
\par
The system contains models for the following elements: \textit{Asset}, \textit{Tags}, \textit{Fields}, \textit{Comments}, \textit{Notifications} and \textit{User}. Out of these the most essential and relevant has been described below. 
\\\\
\textit{Asset} and \textit{Tag} are both key components of the functionality of the system, however in the implementation these models are largely identical. The \textit{Tag} class contains more properties and more functionality than the \textit{Asset} class, and is therefor being described in the report instead.
