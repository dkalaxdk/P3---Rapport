\chapter{Implementation}
In this chapter, the implementation of the previously mentioned elements, as well as the design patterns used throughout the system, will be discussed. Within the system there are more classes than mentioned in this chapter, but only the core and non trivial classes, will be discussed.

% The following class diagram (see \autoref{fig:CompleteClassDiagram}) illustrates the structure of the central part of the the system being developed. It does not include any classes related to either the UI, the database, or the log, but focuses on how the system models the problem domain. 


% The class diagram in \autoref{fig:CompleteClassDiagram} shows the classes within the implemented system, as well as their internal relations. In this diagram some classes have been excluded, as these would cause unnecessary clutter in the diagram. The excluded classes are components from the technical platform \autoref{sc:tech_intro}, as these control the data access layer and UI, and therefor do not represent key components in the logic of the system.
