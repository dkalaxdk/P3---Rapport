\section{General structure}
The design of the system is based on combinations of different design patterns. These patterns are utilized to give an organized and continuous structure throughout the program, as well as increasing the testability of the system, hereby increasing the maintainability of the program. The software is developed with Test Driven Development (TDD) in mind, as functions are developed to be testable, and when possible, developed after the tests have been created.
