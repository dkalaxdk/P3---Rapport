\subsection{Views} \label{ssc:Views}
The view handles the user interaction. The UI is made using a declarative markup language called \textit{XAML}. In a WPF application \textit{XAML} files usually have a file containing code-behind. Code-behind is any code directly parsing or manipulating data from specific \textit{XAML} elements (see \autoref{code:CodeBehindExample}). \citep{XamlOverview}
\par
It is in the code-behind that the views are assigned a \textit{DataContext} (see \autoref{code:CodeBehindExample} line 3 to 7), which in this application is in the form of a view model. When using the \textit{MVVM} pattern, the code-behind should only contain functionality if absolutely necessary. The rest should be contained in the view model \citep{WPFandMVVM}.
\par
In this application the code-behind contains functionality to assign the \textit{DataContext}, as well as sorting lists by clicking column headers, and selecting multiple items (see \autoref{code:CodeBehindExample}).

\subsubsection*{Binding}
The view displays data from the view model. The data is accessed through the public properties of the \textit{DataContext}, which in this case is a view model. This data access is accomplished through data binding expressions \citep{Bindings}.
\par
An example of such a data binding is shown in \autoref{code:DatabindingExample} line 2. Here the text to be displayed in a \textit{TextBox} element is bound to the property \textit{Description} in the view model.

\begin{minted}[frame=lines, framesep=3mm, baselinestretch=1, linenos, bgcolor=LightGray, escapeinside='', breaklines]{xml}

<TextBox Style="{StaticResource ParagraphTextBoxWithSpace}"
         Text="{Binding Description, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"
         TextWrapping="Wrap"
         AcceptsReturn="True"
         AcceptsTab="True"
         MinHeight="80" />

\end{minted}

WPF binding works by connecting the bound item (see \autoref{code:DatabindingExample} line 2) to a public property. This allows for the bound item to update the property and for the property to update the bound item. 
\par
By using WPF binding and implementing the MVVM pattern, it should theoretically be possible to eliminate any code-behind, other than setting the data context. However, when implementing MVVM and using WPF some circumstances arise where binding becomes unnecessarily complex. In these cases the code-behind gets expanded to include logic directly related to the view (see \autoref{code:CodeBehindExample} line 9 to 14). As a result of this the MVVM pattern cannot be implemented fully, as some of the logic is handled within the view itself.

\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}[frame=lines, framesep=3mm, baselinestretch=1, linenos, bgcolor=LightGray, escapeinside='', breaklines]{Csharp}
public partial class TagList : Page
{
    public TagList(ITagListController controller)
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        DataContext = new TagListViewModel(controller);
    }
    
    private void TagAbleList_OnSelectedItemChanged(object sender, RoutedPropertyChangedEventArgs<object> e)
    {
        TagListViewModel vm = this.DataContext as TagListViewModel;
        Tag tag = e.NewValue as Tag;
        vm.SelectedItem = tag;
        
        ...
    }
}
\end{minted}

When code-behind is added to the view, it makes it harder to change the UI framework at a later date, as the view and the functionality are tightly connected, instead of the logic being handled by the view model alone.
