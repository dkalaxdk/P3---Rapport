\section{Actor Table}\label{sc:actortable}

To get an overview of which actors participate in what use cases, an actor table has been created see \autoref{tab:actortable}

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
        \hline
         & \textbf{Admin} & \textbf{Viewer}  \\
        \hline
        Adding an asset & $\pmb{\times}$ & \\
        \hline
        Editing an asset & $\pmb{\times}$ & \\
        \hline
        Adding a tag & $\pmb{\times}$ & \\
        \hline
        Editing a tag & $\pmb{\times}$ & \\
        \hline
        Adding a comment & $\pmb{\times}$ & $\pmb{\times}$ \\
        \hline
        Adding a department & $\pmb{\times}$ & \\
        \hline
        Renaming a department & $\pmb{\times}$ & \\
        \hline
        Searching for an asset & $\pmb{\times}$ & $\pmb{\times}$ \\
        \hline
        Printing a report & $\pmb{\times}$ & \\
        \hline
        Printing the log & $\pmb{\times}$ & \\
        \hline
        Searching the log & $\pmb{\times}$ & \\
        \hline
        Removing an asset or a tag & $\pmb{\times}$ & \\
        \hline
        
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Actor table showing which actors are involved in the different use cases, described in section \ref{sc:usecases}. An actors involvement in a particular use case is marked by an $\pmb{\times}$ in the table.}
    \label{tab:actortable}
\end{table}

As seen in the actor table (table \ref{tab:actortable}) the \textit{admin} is involved in all the use cases, while the \textit{viewer} is only involved in two. This reflects the fact that the program is primarily intended for the \textit{admin}, as they are the ones managing their asserts, while the \textit{viewer} is only given access to view and comment on the assets in the system.
